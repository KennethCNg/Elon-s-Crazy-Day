1. Scoping issues iterating through an array with forEach even though I used a fat-arrow function. I was within an anonymous function and couldn't call "this". I tried binding, but then was getting an error saying I couldn't bind to undefined. I could've declared the variable in the function right before I started the forEach loop, but I opted to use a for loop reason being it allowed me to keep "this" in scope but also return early.
